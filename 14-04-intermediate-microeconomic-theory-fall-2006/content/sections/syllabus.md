Grading and Requirements
------------------------

The final grade in the course will be based on the following weights:

| ACTIVITIES | WEIGHTS |
| --- | --- |
| Midterm Exam | 1/3 |
| Final Exam | 1/2 |
| Homeworks | 1/6 |
| Project | w/k 

Homeworks
---------

Homeworks are due two days after the second lecture session, to be collected at recitations. Alternatively, you may put them (before the recitation) in the TA's mail folder. Joint work is not permitted. You may discuss ideas, help each other with material in general, but, ultimately, your homework has to be a unique written (or typed) piece. Late homework gets no credit.

All issues with rescheduling exams have to be resolved beforehand.
